# Our application is not designed to work with Document DB. That's because of the fact that AWS don't let youto create Document DB without Username and password
# Out cart and catalogue code is not designed to talk to mongodb with credentials.

# Let's try to understand, how can we connect to connect to doc-db. Based on that we can apply that strategy.
